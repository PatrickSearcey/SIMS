            Autogenerated portions of these elements as noted below were retrieved from GWSI when the ADR scripts were run. Now for timeseries sites registered in RMS only, 
            these fields now show 2014 data mined from GWSI. Please review these elements. If you see redundant data, please remove the redundant data from the editable 
            portion of those elements. If there are data in the editable portion of the element that should be seen in the autogenerated portion of the element it is 
            because the data are not stored in GWSI. Please contact your local GWSI data manager to find out how to get these data stored in the appropriate database.  
            These data are refreshed daily.  For an example of these fields prior to this update
